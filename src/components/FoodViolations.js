        This is a manually compiled list of stores, which is based on data
        collected through implementation checklists; these are forms completed
        by Shop Healthy staff as part of store observations that track whether
        each criteria has been met. At this time, the program does not have
        processes in place to ensure that stores maintain the changes past
        one-month.
